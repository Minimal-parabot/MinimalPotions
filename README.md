# All-in-one
Make, flask, bank. This script does it all. The way the script was designed allows the easy addition of potions and streamlines the code. If you happen to run out of supplies, you will be safely logged out and the script will be stopped.
# Reliable
Like all other Minimal scripts, this features the null check feature that kicks your character from the server if it detects that something goes wrong. This ensures that you lose the least amount of time and get back to making potions as quick as possible.
# Exclusive
This script is not available for all people to use. It is strictly for VIP+ members of Parabot, giving you and your bot farm more control over the Ikov economy.
